After some general research over the week, I've analysed the main processes of neuroscience behind the human eye. 
I have an ok grasp of the theory , as I type this: however, delving into the chemical processes of how we see, 

I am firm in believing a suitable implant can be developed to enhance, restore, or replace how we see. 
Right now I'm brainstorming a few good ideas and consulting my professors on my ideas, seeking advice and seeing if I overlooked any of the science. 

I still do believe more scientific theory is needed before i even start drawing up prototypes, as I am not confident in my current work.
